Kabali is a pseudo code created on the top of php:
you will need php engine to run this.
since php is a server side scripting you have to use one of the servers below:
wamp
xamp
iis 

and upload the above files
in the www ot htdocs directories within a new folder.
now initially a sample kabali program is given named -----nl.kabali----.
if u try to open that folder index.php will run and ask for the file to execute
to execute sample program enter nl.kabali in that textbox.
After craeting your new program upload in that same folder and enter your file name instead
with.kabali extension.
